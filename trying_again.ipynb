    "Well, so far we have discovered that our classification systems are pretty bad. I suspect that this has a lot to do with filtering of the lower frequencies in the audio samples, as in general the noise introduced during audio recording is located in the lower registers. There might also be issues with the incorrect onsets, so we'll do our best to see if we can get things more lined up this time around. For the sake of time, as in the last notebook, we will test our workings on a smaller sample size of say 5 different classes (out of 91), so that we can better deduce what the major issues will be."
